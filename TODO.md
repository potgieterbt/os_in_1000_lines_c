# TODO:
- [ ] A proper memory allocator that allows freeing memory.
- [ ] Interrupt handling. Do not busy-wait for disk I/O.
- [ ] A full-fledged file system. Implementing ext2 would be a good start.
- [ ] Network communication (TCP/IP). It's not hard to implement UDP/IP (TCP is somewhat advanced). Virtio-net is very similar to virtio-blk!
